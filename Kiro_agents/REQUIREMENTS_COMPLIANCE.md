  - `lambda/code-execution/index.py`
  - `lambda/storage/index.py`
- **Purpose**: Execute agent actions
- **Evidence**: Lines 30-68 in stack

- **Implementation**: Via CDK
- **Purpose**: Automated provisioning

## Requirement 3: AI Agent Qualifications ✅

### 3.1 Uses Reasoning LLMs ✅

**Evidence**: Nova Pro model with explicit reasoning instructions

```typescript
instruction: `You are an intelligent research assistant with autonomous capabilities. 
Your role is to help users research topics, analyze data, and provide insights.

Use your reasoning capabilities to:
- Break down complex research tasks into steps
- Decide which tools to use and when
- Synthesize information from multiple sources
- Provide well-reasoned conclusions

Always think through your approach before taking action.`
```

**Reasoning Capabilities Demonstrated**:
1. Task decomposition
2. Tool selection logic
3. Multi-step planning
4. Information synthesis

### 3.2 Demonstrates Autonomous Capabilities ✅

**Without Human Input**:
- Agent independently decides which tools to use
- Chains multiple tool calls without prompting
- Stores and retrieves its own findings
- Adjusts strategy based on results

**With Human Input**:
- Accepts high-level goals
- Executes multi-step plans autonomously
- Reports back with results

**Example Autonomous Flow**:
```
User: "Research AI in healthcare and store findings"

Agent Autonomous Actions:
1. Decides to use web_search tool
2. Analyzes search results
3. Decides to use execute_code for analysis
4. Decides to use storage to persist findings
5. Synthesizes and reports results

No human intervention required for steps 1-5
```

### 3.3 Integrates External Tools ✅

#### Tool 1: Web Search
- **Type**: External information retrieval
- **Integration**: Lambda function via Action Group
- **API**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **File**: `lambda/web-search/index.py`
- **Capability**: Search and retrieve information

#### Tool 2: Code Execution
- **Type**: Computational tool
- **Integration**: Lambda function via Action Group
- **API**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **File**: `lambda/code-execution/index.py`
- **Capability**: Execute Python for calculations

#### Tool 3: Storage (S3)
- **Type**: Database/storage integration
- **Integration**: Lambda function via Action Group
- **API**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **File**: `lambda/storage/index.py`
- **Capability**: Persist and retrieve data

#### Multi-Tool Orchestration
The agent can combine tools:
```
web_search → execute_code → storage
```

## Additional Strengths

### 1. Production-Ready Infrastructure
- Infrastructure as Code (CDK)
- Automated deployment
- Security best practices
- Monitoring and logging

### 2. Scalability
- Serverless architecture
- Auto-scaling Lambda
- Managed Bedrock service
- Unlimited S3 storage

### 3. Extensibility
- Easy to add new tools
- Modular action groups
- OpenAPI specifications
- Clear separation of concerns

### 4. Testing
- Comprehensive test script
- Multiple test scenarios
- Autonomous behavior validation
- Tool integration verification
