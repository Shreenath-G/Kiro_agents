## ü§ñ Autonomous Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Detecting and Fixing Ad Fatigue
```
Agent detects: CTR declining 15% over 3 days on campaign goog-camp-002
Agent analyzes: Ad fatigue detected, frequency too high
Agent decides: Pause underperforming ads, activate backup creatives
Agent executes: Pauses 3 ads, activates 2 new variants, adjusts budget
Result: CTR recovers to baseline within 24 hours
```

### Example 2: Budget Reallocation
```
Agent monitors: Campaign A has 3.2x ROAS, Campaign B has 0.8x ROAS
Agent reasons: Shift budget from B to A while maintaining minimum spend on B
Agent calculates: Optimal allocation is 70% to A, 30% to B
Agent executes: Reallocates $1,200 from B to A
Result: Overall ROAS increases from 1.5x to 2.3x
```

### Example 3: Market Adaptation
```
Agent detects: CPM increased 40% across all campaigns
Agent analyzes: Competitor increased ad spend, market more competitive
Agent reasons: Need strategic response - adjust targeting and schedule
Agent executes: Refines audience, optimizes ad schedule, tests new angles
Result: Maintains performance despite market changes
```
